      <h2>What is Geolocation API ?</h2>
      <p>
        Geolocation APIs enable developers to access a device's geolocation, it
        utilizes various methods like WIFI, GPS, and IP to determine a user's
        location, and returns latitude/longitude coordinates and a radius
        indicating result accuracy. Geolocation APIs are pivotal elements for
        creating features such as location-based services, maps, navigation, and
        local search, which leads to personalized content and directions. This
        functionality is also essential in areas like emergency services, asset
        tracking, and IoT devices.

      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Stalking:</strong> A significant drawback of geolocation APIs
          involves the potential for inadvertent disclosure of one's location on

          attacks by those with malicious intent.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Concerns and Data Rights:</strong> With the growth of privacy
          awareness, according to Matthew Crozier (n.d.)<br/>
          <blockquote cite="https://granicus.com/blog/pros-cons-using-geolocation-online-community-engagement/">“Jurisdictions leading
          the way on data privacy like Europe and Canada, along with some US
          Federal Statutes such as COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection
          Act) are starting to form an opinion that IP addresses are PII, or
          “personal data”” <cite>(Matthew Crozier, n.d.)</cite>.</blockquote><br/> 
          Gathering such information without explicit consent may pose legal and ethical challenges,emphasizing the need for caution in data collection.</p>
